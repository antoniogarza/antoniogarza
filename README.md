# Antonio Garza — Lead / Senior Full-Stack Engineer

I build and ship **production web/mobile systems** with a focus on **TypeScript/Node + React**, clean architecture, and reliable delivery.  
I’ve led teams through **complex, cross-functional projects** (UX, data, product) and I’m strongest at turning messy requirements into **shippable software**.

**Quick hits**
- 8+ years building full-stack apps (React/React Native, Node, SQL/NoSQL)
- Cross-platform experience with **Electron** and **Flutter**
- Comfortable in enterprise / security-conscious environments (least-privilege, auditability, private-cloud constraints)
- Interested in climate/energy-impact work

## Professional experience (high-level)

**Chaione — Lead Software Engineer**
- Led end-to-end delivery for enterprise client projects: discovery → architecture → implementation → release
- Built full-stack systems with **TypeScript/Node + React**, integrating complex workflows and third-party services
- Partnered closely with UX, data, and product teams; drove alignment and execution under tight timelines
- Focused on quality and reliability: testing strategy, observability, performance tuning, and secure-by-default practices
- Mentored engineers and improved delivery standards through code reviews, patterns, and documentation

> Note: Work samples from client projects are often proprietary, so my public repos focus on personal and open projects.
